// Make a Calculator! Using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.

// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

firstNumber = prompt("Enter first number:");
secondNumber = prompt("Enter second number:");
sum = Number(firstNumber) + Number(secondNumber);
diff = Number(firstNumber) - Number(secondNumber);
mult = Number(firstNumber) * Number(secondNumber);
div = Number(firstNumber) / Number(secondNumber);
alert(sum + ", " + diff + ", " + mult + ", " + div);
